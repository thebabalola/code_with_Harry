// 1 . Create a variable of type string and try to add a number to it
let myVar = 'my string';

const myObj = {

// --- CHAPTER 3 ---
// 1 . Write a program that prints the mark of a student in an object using for loop

const studentMark = {
	'Harry': 98,
	'Rohan': 70,
	'Aakash': 7
}

const printMark = () => {
	// Use Object.keys() to iterate over the keys of the object
	for (let i = 0; i < Object.keys(studentMark).length; i++) {
		const student = Object.keys(studentMark)[i]; // Gets student name
		console.log(`${student}: ${studentMark[student]}`); // Prints student's mark
	}
}

printMark();

/*
Iteration Method: Use Object.keys(studentMark) to get an array of the keys (student names) in the object, allowing you to iterate over them with a for loop.
Length Calculation: Change the loop condition to < Object.keys(studentMark).length instead of <= to avoid going out of bounds.
Accessing Values: Inside the loop, access the value using the student name from the keys array.
*/



// 2 . Write the program above using For in Loop

const printMarks = function(){
	// saves studentMark into Students variable
	for (let students in studentMark){
		console.log(`${students}: ${studentMark[students]}`); 
		//prints in this format:- student: mark
	}
}

printMarks();

/*
The logic behind the console.

- In the loop, 'students' represents the current key (or property name) of the studentMark object during each iteration. It could be 'Harry', 'Rohan', or 'Aakash'.

- studentMark[student], uses bracket notation to access the value associated with the current student key in the studentMark object.
This retrieves the corresponding mark for that student (e.g., studentMark['Harry'] returns 98).*/



// 3. Write a program that prints 'try again' until user enters the correct number

function appropriateNum(numEntered) {
	return numEntered < 0 ? 'try again' : 'number is valid';
}

console.log(appropriateNum(-3));
console.log(appropriateNum(45));



// 4. Write a function to find the mean of 5 numbers
function findMean(num1, num2, num3, num4, num5){
	return (num1 + num2 + num3 + num4 + num5) / 5;
}

console.log(findMean(2, 13, 27, 8, 19));
